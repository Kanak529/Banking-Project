Banking-Project

The objective of this model is to analyze customer churn behavior using demographic, financial, and behavioral variables, with the aim of identifying high-risk customer segments

1. Project Overview
The Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard is a Power BI-based analytics solution developed to understand and predict customer attrition behavior in a retail banking context. The dashboard provides interactive insights into which customers are most likely to leave and why—based on demographic, financial, and behavioral variables. It serves as a strategic tool for analysts, product teams, and customer success managers to make informed retention decisions.

2. Objective
The primary objective of this model is to analyze patterns of customer churn and identify high-risk segments. The dashboard aims to answer critical business questions such as:

Which customer segments exhibit the highest churn risk?

How do financial status, engagement level, and tenure influence retention?

What role do product bundling and behavioral traits play in customer loyalty?

3. Tools and Technologies Used
This project was built using the following tools and methods:

Power BI Desktop – Main platform for data visualization and dashboard development

Power Query – Used for data cleaning, shaping, and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures, KPIs, and dynamic metrics

Data Modeling – Structured relationships among tables to enable cross-filtering


4. Dataset Description
Source: Simulated banking dataset with approximately 10,000 customer records.

Data Attributes:

Demographics: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Geography

Behavioral: Number of Products, Tenure, IsActiveMember, HasCrCard

Financial: Credit Score, Balance, Estimated Salary

Outcome Variable: Exited (1 = Customer churned, 0 = Retained)

5. Key Features and Visuals
Business Problem
Retail banks often struggle with customer attrition due to intense market competition and low switching costs. Raw data alone makes it difficult to identify root causes or develop targeted retention plans. This dashboard addresses the need for a clear, interactive tool to analyze churn trends and derive actionable insights.

Dashboard Goals
Visualize churn behavior across customer segments

Enable data-driven segmentation and targeting

Provide economic context to support strategic decision-making

Visual Highlights
Visual Component	                                              Description
Churn Rate by Geography and Age Group	            Identifies regions and age bands with high churn propensity
Tenure vs. Churn Trend	                            Shows likelihood of churn across different customer lifespans
Product Holding Analysis	                        Examines correlation between number of products and churn risk
Financial Profile Comparison	                    Highlights differences in balance and salary between churned and retained customers
Interactive Slicers	Filters by gender, region, credit score range, active status, and more
KPI Summary Cards	Displays key metrics such as overall churn rate, average tenure, and segment-level churn indicators

6. Business Insights and Applications
Focus Area	Insights
Customer Segmentation	High churn observed among single-product, low-tenure, inactive customers
Marketing Optimization	Tailored retention campaigns can be designed for specific age groups or geographies
Product Strategy	Product bundling and multi-service usage are associated with lower churn
Behavioral Economics	

Switching Costs: Loyalty increases with product depth

Adverse Selection: Some churners have strong credit profiles, suggesting misalignment in value proposition

Inertia and Disengagement: Inactive customers with high financial stability may leave due to lack of perceived value |

7. Conclusion
The Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard combines analytical rigor with business relevance. Through powerful visualizations and dynamic segmentation, it allows organizations to proactively manage churn and design smarter retention strategies—rooted in data and economic logic.
